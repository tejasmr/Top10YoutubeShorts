# Top10YoutubeShorts

The goal of this project was to compile top 10 youtube shorts in the genres of Finance, Fitness, Dance, Gaming, Streaming and Movies. It searches and takes the video metadata of such videos of each genre, it adds some overlay and concatenates all these videos. The final video for each genre is uploaded to youtube using Youtube Data API v3 and all the videos generated is deleted.

Using this will violate YouTube terms and policy. So I am archiving it
